**Melologue I Dido (inspired by Didon by Piccinni):**

In the shadow of my broken memories, I stand alone, surrounded by the pain of lost love. Every step leads me deeper into the labyrinth of memory, where gentle echoes of broken promises still linger. Each faded glance holds your reflection, engraved in the silence of my suffering.

Like an abandoned queen, I wander among the ruins of my past, stumbling on remnants of what was, collapsing under the unbearable weight of a broken promise. My heart echoes with death, howling desperately through the remains of my dying kingdom, between shattered columns and arches worn by time. A constant lament fills the air, accompanying each breath I take.

In this darkness of abandonment, among shadows whispering ancient truths, a faint, resilient light still flickers—a fragile, nearly invisible hope. It is my final sigh, my silent goodbye: adieu, mon cher Enée, mon dernier soupir est pour toi.

**Melologue II Dido (inspired by "La Didone abbandonata" by Domenico Sarro):**

From my throne, powerless and immobile, I witness the collapse of the world I built with care, now reduced to ashes under the relentless weight of destiny. Everything familiar crumbles slowly as I watch the end of all that was precious.

A lifelong companion drifts away, elusive and distant, pulling me inevitably into the dark tide of his deceitful promises. Each spoken word turns to salt upon my wounds, each memory an anchor dragging me deeper into unreachable depths.

The palace walls hold regret, vibrating quietly with melancholy, whispering through empty rooms and deserted corridors. They transform my growing anger into a rushing torrent of fire, a consuming flame ready to engulf everything and everyone in its path.

Fire, an unending flame burning away every bond, every memory, every trace of past happiness. It is my soul, ignited by solitude, destined to consume itself in despair.

**Melologue III Dido (inspired by "Dido and Aeneas" by Henry Purcell):**

Seated in now-silent gardens, my heart torn by an imminent farewell, I watch helplessly as a dear friend departs. The wind murmurs words I cannot understand; dry leaves gently fall, each one a regret, a fragment of what once was and can never be again.

Joyful memories fade, blurred by passing days, slipping through my fingers like grains of sand. He leaves, moving beyond my reach, leaving me alone with the unbearable weight of emptiness. Each step without him leads deeper into the abyss.

A thin mist envelops everything, cloaking the world in sadness and uncertainty, as if fate itself reminds me of my fragility. Yet, from deep within my sorrow emerges a gentle melody, a distant echo of happier times, deepening the wound opened by his departure.

Through this silence and darkness, I wish only to reach him with one desperate plea: remember me.
