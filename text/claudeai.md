## Melologue I - Dido (inspired by Piccinni's Didon)

In the shadow of my shattered memories, I find myself alone, enveloped by the pain of a lost love. Hours pass slowly like sand in an infinite hourglass, each grain a thought of what was and will never be again.

The wind carries the echo of promises whispered beneath complicit stars, now silent witnesses to my abandonment. In the silence, I search for an answer that does not come, in the darkness for a light that has been extinguished.

The walls of my palace, once vibrant with life, now resonate with the emptiness left by your departure. Every corner preserves a memory, every room a fragment of happiness now shattered.

Like an abandoned queen, among the ruins of my past, I collapse under the weight of a broken promise. My hands, which once held yours, now grasp only the cold air of absence. My chest resounds with death, howling like the wind through the columns of my dying kingdom.

A lament fills the air... a sigh that crosses the sea, chasing distant sails. It is the voice of my heart still calling to you, although reason tells me you are now unreachable.

Days follow one another, indifferent to my pain. The moon rises and sets, a silent witness to my solitude. Yet something persists, stubborn like a flower blooming among stones.

In the darkness of this abandonment, a faint light continues to shine, a hope, a last breath. It is not resignation, but acceptance. Not oblivion, but memory transforming. The memory of you, which now wounds me, may one day be balm for the wounded soul.

In this melancholic sunset, as the sun gives way to night, I contemplate my destiny with new eyes. Abandonment is not the end, but a threshold to cross toward a future yet to be written, with or without you.

## Melologue II - Dido (inspired by Domenico Sarro's "La Didone abbandonata")

From the height of the throne, I watch the collapse of the world I knew, powerless. The power I once held firmly now slips through my fingers like fine sand, impossible to retain.

The foundations of the kingdom tremble, not from external invaders but from the earthquake that shakes me from within. An empire built stone by stone, sacrifice after sacrifice, now falters under the weight of deceit.

A life companion departs, dragging me along into the sea of deceptive promises. Every word spoken, every solemn oath, now floats like the wreckage of a sunken ship in the waters of betrayal.

I wonder if you already knew, while whispering words of love, that they were destined to dissipate like fog at sunrise. If while looking into my eyes, you already saw the distant horizon that would welcome you.

The palace walls enclose regret, whisper melancholy, transforming my anger into a river of... uncontrollable fury. Like a storm that crashes upon the coast, my feelings shatter against the rocks of reality.

Fire ready to engulf anyone who approaches. The flames of my wrath blaze high in the sky, visible from afar like a beacon of desperation. May you see them from the sea, may they illuminate your journey as an eternal warning.

I wish to tear you from my heart like one removes a thorn, but I fear the void left would bleed even more. The wound of abandonment does not heal with time, it transforms into a scar that reminds with every glance.

Yet in this storm of emotions, in this vortex of pain and anger, I find a new strength. No longer queen by birthright or by bond, but sovereign of my own destiny. If I must fall, I will fall like a star, leaving a luminous trail in the sky of history.

## Melologue III - Dido (inspired by Henry Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas")

Sitting among the gardens, my heart torn by the departure of a dear friend. The roses I once gathered with joy now seem to wither under my gaze, mirroring my spirit slowly bending.

The sun filters through the foliage, creating plays of light that once would have enchanted me. Now each ray is merely a memory of shared moments, each shadow a presage of the emptiness awaiting me.

Happy memories fade and he goes away, leaving me alone with the weight of the abyss. I can still hear the echo of his words, the sound of his footsteps, the scent of his presence, now just ghosts inhabiting the empty rooms of my memory.

I cling to these fragments like a castaway to a wooden board amid the storm, fearing that even these, with time, might slip away, leaving me completely alone.

A mist envelops the atmosphere, as if destiny itself were whispering its tragedy. The world around me loses clarity, outlines blur, and I wonder if it is reality changing or my view of it.

The sky, once so clear, now seems heavy with rain, reflecting the tumult I feel inside. Each drop that will fall will be a tear I no longer have the strength to shed.

Yet, in the depths of sorrow, a sweet melody caresses my soul, a distant echo of a once happy time now lost amplifies the void he left. It is the music of our laughter, of exchanged words, of shared silences. A symphony that now plays only for me, incomplete and melancholic.

Death no longer frightens me more than life without you. I see in it not the end, but a passage, perhaps to places where pain cannot follow me. Where abandonment does not exist because everything is eternal.

Before the last light goes out, before the last breath leaves my tired body, I would like to tell him, across the time and space that separate us, across the sea that carries him away...

Remember me. Not as a queen, not as an abandoned lover, but as a soul that knew how to love without reservation. Remember me when the wind whispers, when the sea ripples, when night gives way to dawn. Remember me as I will remember you, until the last heartbeat.

Remember me.
